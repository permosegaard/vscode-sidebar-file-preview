## Features

- Watches for file changes, no manual refreshes required
- Convenient button to edit the file (creating if necessary) 
- Defaults to TODO.md, but changeable to any filename in settings
- This is designed mainly to keep TODO.md visible, but I'm happy to take pull requests for feature additions if they're ~in scope

## Configuration

- `preview.previewView.filename` â€” Override default filename
